# Hyperloop ðŸš„

Speed up your new Rails 8.0 projects with a preconfigured set of tools !

## Usage

If you don't have yet the project cloned, fetch it from remote URL:

```shell
$ rails new myapp -m https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anthony-robin/hyperloop/master/template.rb
```

If you already have it cloned:

```shell
$ rails new myapp -m hyperloop/template.rb
```

> [!WARNING]
> Some arguments from the `rails new` command might not be compatible with the template. Here are some flags that works well:
>
> ```bash
> $ rails new myapp -m hyperloop/template.rb --skip-ci --skip-test --skip-system-test --skip-brakeman --skip-active-storage --skip-action-text --skip-action-mailbox --skip-kamal --skip-git
> ```

Wait for the end of the installer, then start it with:

```shell
$ bin/dev
```
