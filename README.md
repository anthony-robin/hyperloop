# Hyperloop ðŸš„

Speed up your new Rails 8.0 projects with a preconfigured set of tools !

## Usage

If you don't have yet the project cloned, fetch it from remote URL:

```shell
$ rails new myapp -m https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anthony-robin/hyperloop/master/template.rb
```

If you already have it cloned:

```shell
$ rails new myapp -m hyperloop/template.rb
```

> [!WARNING]
> Some arguments from the `rails new` command might not be compatible with the template. Here are some flags that work well:
>
> ```bash
> $ rails new myapp -m hyperloop/template.rb --skip-ci --skip-test --skip-system-test --skip-brakeman --skip-active-storage --skip-action-text --skip-action-mailbox --skip-kamal --skip-git
> ```

Generator will ask several questions to refine configuration:
- What port the server should run (default: `3000`)
- What language the app should handle (default: `en`)
- Is an authentication needed ?
  - If yes, does an admin dashboard is needed ?

Wait for the end of the installer, then start it with:

```shell
$ bin/dev
```

- A minimal admin dashboard is created if requested on generator prompt. This feature includes the [pretender](https://github.com/ankane/pretender) gem to sign in as another user to manage it easily.
- SEO is preconfigured to work in any pages by default and title/description can be specified directly in `seo.{locale}.yml` file.
- Default browser confirm modal as been replaced with a pretty and friendly one following excellent [gorails tutorial](https://gorails.com/episodes/custom-hotwire-turbo-confirm-modals)

  ```shell
  $ docker-compose up -d

### Locales

Project is compatible for `english` and `french` locales out of the box. When generator ask for locales, answer in two letters ISO 639 language code. For multiple locales, separate them with a comma. For example:

```
- en
- fr
- en,fr
```

> [!NOTE]
> In case of multiples locales, the default will be the first one specified.
