# Hyperloop ðŸš„

Speed up your new Rails 7.1 projects with a preconfigured set of tools !

> [!NOTE]
> This template has been built to match as best as possible default changes I make on every new Rails project I work on. It is very opinionated for some configuration so feel free to fork it and adapt it according to your needs.

## Usage

If you don't have yet the project cloned, fetch it from remote URL:

```shell
$ rails new myapp -m https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anthony-robin/hyperloop/master/template.rb
```

If you already cloned it:

```shell
$ rails new myapp -m hyperloop/template.rb
```

Wait for the end of the installer, then start it with:

```shell
$ bin/dev
```
